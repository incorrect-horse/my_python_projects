Cards

Not an actual card game, but an exercise to learn object manipulation within an OOP project. Script creates a deck of 52 card objects that can be shuffled, drawn, discarded, reshuffled, redrawn, etc. For example. an Ace of Spades object remains persistent throughout the 'game' regardless of how many times it is shuffled, drawn, or discarded.
