Movie Night Recommender with Python

Project Description

Create a simple Python program that suggests a random movie based on the genre the user selects. The program will use a predefined dictionary of movies and genres, allowing users to get a quick recommendation without endless scrolling.

movies = {
    "Action": ["Mad Max: Fury Road", "John Wick", "Die Hard", "Gladiator"],
    "Comedy": ["Superbad", "Step Brothers", "The Big Lebowski", "Dumb and Dumber"],
    "Drama": ["Forrest Gump", "The Shawshank Redemption", "Titanic", "The Green Mile"],
    "Sci-Fi": ["Interstellar", "Inception", "The Matrix", "Blade Runner 2049"],
    "Horror": ["The Conjuring", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Get Out", "The Exorcist"]
}

Expected Output

The program displays some initial message (i.e., Welcome to the Movie Night…) and then prompts the user to enter a genre. The user has entered “Drama” in the following example, so the program has selected a random movie from the “Drama” category (i.e., The Green Mile).
